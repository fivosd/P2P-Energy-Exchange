# Peer-to-Peer Energy Exchange
### Hack from Home 2021
The P2P Energy Exchange is aiming to revolutionize and democratize energy markets. Our innovative platform integrates individual nodes (households, producers, buildings or, regions) into a decentralized energy market. To deploy our decentralization system, we are offering automated intra-node energy flow optimization. This demo is a proof of concept for this said optimization. We use proprietary algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) to best allocate energy resources within a given context.

In this demo we are simulating a 4 home complex, located in Amsterdam, with 64 250W panels totalling 115m^2, there is also a 43Kwh Battery pack and, a grid connection. We assume a baseline consumption of 4Kwh per home. To simulate solar energy yield we use NASAâ€™s POWER API to find historic irradiance data.
